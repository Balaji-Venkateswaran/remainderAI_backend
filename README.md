# LLM-Powered Reminder Application (Python)
An intelligent reminder app built with Python and LLMs that understands natural language to create smart reminders. Users can set one-time or recurring reminders for tasks, bills, meetings, and services. The app auto-extracts dates, time, and intent, integrates with calendars, and notifies users at the right moment.

🧠 LLM-Powered Reminder Application (Python)

An intelligent reminder system built using Python and a Large Language Model (LLM).
Unlike traditional reminder apps that require manual input of title, date, and time, this app understands natural language and automatically creates smart reminders for everything.

🚀 Overview

Users can type or speak reminders in plain language, and the LLM extracts all required details such as time, date, repetition, and intent.
The app supports personal, work, health, billing, and service-related reminders.

✨ Example Inputs

Remind me to service my AC after 3 months

Pay electricity bill on 5th every month

Call client tomorrow at 10 AM

🧩 What the LLM Extracts

Title / Intent

Date & Time

Repeat Pattern (daily / weekly / monthly / custom)

Priority

Category (personal, work, health, service, bills)

🔔 Smart Features

✅ One-time reminders (auto-stop after completion)

🔁 Recurring reminders (daily / weekly / monthly)

⚠️ Missed reminder handling (overdue & follow-ups)

📅 Calendar integration (optional – Google Calendar)

📷 Appliance reminder mode (optional)

Identify appliance from photo or user input

Set service reminders (e.g., “Next service in 6 months”)

Show nearby service centers

⚙️ How It Works (High Level)

User enters reminder text (text / voice / image).

LLM converts input into structured JSON.

Reminder data is stored in the database.

Scheduler (cron/worker) checks due reminders.

Notification is triggered at the correct time.

Reminder stops or continues based on type.

Scheduler / Worker
Runs periodically to detect due reminders

Notification Service
Push / In-app / Email / SMS

Storage Layer
